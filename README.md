## Features

- A **search bar** allows users to search breweries by name.
- Instant updates on search queries followed by new results.

### 2. Paginated List of Breweries
- Breweries are displayed in a paginated list.
- Navigation between pages updates the results dynamically using the router.

### 3. Brewery Details
- Detailed information about a selected brewery, such as:
    - Type of brewery
    - Location (address, city, state, postal code)
    - Official website (if available)
- Metadata for brewery details dynamically updates the page title and description.

### 4. Routing and Navigation
- **Home Page**: Displays the brewer list with options to search and paginate.
- **Details Page**: Displays detailed data for a selected brewery via dynamic route parameters.
- **Redirect for Undefined Routes**: Friendly user flow for invalid URLs, redirecting back to the Home Page.
